Functional Programming Lab Away Day 2014
========================================

This repository contains the website for the event in the branch
"gh-pages". The "master" branch contains the code used to generate the
proceedings. Note that we do not include the actual submissions from
which the proceedings are generated, as not all of these can be
published publicly.

To change the order of the proceedings, you have to change the order
in the "ordering" file as well as in "proceedings.tex" to update the
table of contents.
